# iCATERYou - Online Catering Reservation Platform

## MVP Implementation Plan

Based on the flowchart and documentation, I'll create a modern catering reservation website with the following components:

### Core Files to Create:
1. **src/pages/Landing.tsx** - Modern landing page with hero section, features, and call-to-action
2. **src/pages/Login.tsx** - Login page for both clients and members
3. **src/pages/Signup.tsx** - Registration page with role selection
4. **src/pages/Dashboard.tsx** - Main dashboard after login
5. **src/pages/Bookings.tsx** - Booking management and listing page
6. **src/pages/Services.tsx** - Service/menu browsing page
7. **src/components/Navbar.tsx** - Navigation component
8. **src/components/Footer.tsx** - Footer component

### Key Features to Implement:
- Landing page with modern design showcasing iCATERYou
- User authentication flow (login/signup for clients and catering providers)
- Dashboard with different views for clients vs service providers
- Booking system interface
- Service listings and menu browsing
- Responsive navigation
- Modern UI following the flowchart logic

### Technology Stack:
- React + TypeScript
- Shadcn/UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation
- Local state management (no backend integration)

The implementation will follow the flowchart flow: START → Login/Signup → Dashboard → Services/Bookings → Transaction flow.
